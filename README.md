# **Rock, Paper, or Scissors**

The Rock, Paper, or Scissors program is a classic two-player game that compares the items each player chooses. This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript), has been an invaluable exercise in using functions using JavaScript.


## Project Prompt

Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

The possible outcomes are:

- Rock destroys scissors.
- Scissors cut paper.
- Paper covers rock.
- If there’s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.

Our code will break the game into four parts:

1. Get the user’s choice.
2. Get the computer’s choice.
3. Compare the two choices and determine a winner.
4. Start the program and display the results.
